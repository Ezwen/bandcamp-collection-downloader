= Release process

Everything is manual at the moment.

. Make sure that `README.adoc` is up-to-date with the current state of the project (especially CLI options), and make a commit if required.
. Make sure the git local repository is clean (ie. nothing listed with `git status`).
. Change the following files:
.. `CHANGELOG.adoc` with an added section (`==`) titled with the release number, with a list of novelties and with a list of contributors.
.. `src/main/kotlin/bandcampcollectiondownloader/Constants.kt` with a new version number.
. Make a commit with both files and with the new version number:
+
```
git add CHANGELOG.adoc src/main/kotlin/bandcampcollectiondownloader/core/Constants.kt
git commit -m "Release vYYYY-MM-DD"
```
+
where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date.
+
. Add a tag with the new version number:
+
```
git tag vYYYY-MM-DD
```
+
. Push everything to the remote git repository, including the new tag:
+
```
git push --tags
```
+
. Wait for the CI pipeline build to be done, then open the corresponding pipeline page, then open the `build` build page, then *press the _Keep_ button.*
. Press `Browse` and navigate to the `.jar` file until you find the URL, and copy the URL (or replace `<Job ID>` in the URL below). It should look like this:
+
```
https://framagit.org/Ezwen/bandcamp-collection-downloader/-/jobs/<Job ID>/artifacts/raw/build/libs/bandcamp-collection-downloader.jar?inline=false
```
+
NOTE: Replacing the job ID in the URL above should work?
+
. Go to the _Releases_ page: https://framagit.org/Ezwen/bandcamp-collection-downloader/-/releases and press `New release`
. In _Tag Name_, select the tag `vYYYY-MM-DD` where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date.
. In _Release notes_, copy and paste the content of the release notes.
. In _Release assets_, put the jar URL prepared previously with the title `Executable jar`.
. Press _Create Release_.

And done! ðŸŽ‰
